1. Acceptance of this Agreement
DOORDER LIMITED, provides an online marketplace connection, using web-based technology that
connects you and other consumers, retailers and/or other businesses and independent delivery contractors
(“Contractors”). DOORDER LIMITED’s software permits consumers to place orders for non-refrigerated

Once a delivery order is made, the Software notifies DOORDER LIMITED that a delivery opportunity is
available, once the order is ready for collection a Contractor will be notified and the Software facilitates
completion of the delivery to the consumer. Once a pickup order is made, the Software communicates with
the customer regarding the availability of the order for pickup. DOORDER LIMITED is not a retailer but
facilitates retailers by offering an alternative delivery service to those currently available via its Software.

5. Contractors and Retailers Are Independent
You understand and agree that DOORDER LIMITED provides a technology platform connecting you with
independent service providers and others that provide the products offered through the Services
(“Retailers”), and independent third-party contractors who provide delivery services (“Contractors”). You
acknowledge and agree that DOORDER LIMITED does not itself prepare goods or offer delivery services,
and has no responsibility or liability for the acts or omissions of any Reailers or any Contractor.
DOORDER LIMITED is not in the delivery business nor is it a common carrier. DOORDER LIMITED
provides a technology platform facilitating the transmission of orders by Users to Retailers for pickup or
delivery by Contractors. DOORDER LIMITED will not assess or guarantee the suitability, legality or ability
of any Contractor or Retailer. You agree that DOORDER LIMITED is not responsible for the Retailer’s
preparation or the safety of the goods or whether the photographs or images or information displayed
through the Services accurately reflect the goods prepared by the Retailers and/or delivered by the
Contractor, and does not verify Retailers’ compliance with applicable laws or regulations. DOORDER
LIMITED has no responsibility or liability for acts or omissions by any Retailer or Contractor.
You agree that the goods that you deliver will be prepared by the Retailer for the order you have accepted
and that for delivery orders, the Contractor will be directed by software instructions to transport the products
to the designated delivery location. You agree that neither the Contractor nor DOORDER LIMITED holds
title to or acquires any ownership interest in any goods that you deliver through the Services.
6. Communications with DOORDER LIMITED
By creating a DOORDER LIMITED account, you electronically agree to accept and receive communications
from DOORDER LIMITED, or third parties providing services to DOORDER LIMITED, or Retailer’s
customers, including via email, text message, WhatsApp, calls, and push notifications to the mobile number
and/or email you provide to DOORDER LIMITED. You understand and agree that you may receive
communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded
messages sent by or on behalf of DOORDER LIMITED, its affiliated companies and/or Contractor, including
but not limited to communications concerning orders placed through your account on the Services.
Message and data rates may apply.
7. Registration T&C’s Disclosure
By creating a DOORDER LIMITED account, you also consent to the use of an electronic record to document
your agreement. You may withdraw your consent to the use of the electronic record by emailing DOORDER
LIMITED at info@doorder.eu with “Revoke Electronic Consent” in the subject line.
To view and retain a copy of this disclosure, you will need (i) a device (such as a computer or mobile phone)

DOORDER LIMITED alone (and/or its licensors where applicable) shall own all right, title and interest,
including all related intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and the Services. This Agreement is
not a sale and does not convey to you any rights of ownership in or related to the Software or the Services,
or any intellectual property rights owned by DOORDER LIMITED names, DOORDER LIMITED logos, and
the product names associated with the Software and Services are trademarks of DOORDER LIMITED or
third parties, and no right or license is granted to use them. You agree that you will not remove, alter or
obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or

9. Dispute Resolution.
(a) Scope of Arbitration Agreement. You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your
access or use of the Services as a User of the Services, to any advertising or marketing communications
regarding DOORDER LIMITED or the Services, to any products or services sold or distributed through the
Services that you received as aContractor of our Services, or to any aspect of your relationship or
transactions with DOORDER LIMITED as a User of our Services will be resolved at the option and discretion
of DOORDER LIMITED by binding arbitration, rather than in court.
(b) Informal Resolution. You and DOORDER LIMITED agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve
disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You and DOORDER
LIMITED therefore agree that, before either you or DOORDER LIMITED demands arbitration against the
other, we will meet and confer, including via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to resolve
informally any claim covered by this mutual Agreement. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel
may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. The party initiating
the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal dispute
resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such notice, unless
an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. To notify DOORDER LIMITED that you intend to
initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, email info@doorder.eu, providing your name, telephone
number associated with your DOORDER LIMITED account (if any), the email address associated with your
DOORDER LIMITED account, and a description of your claim. Engaging in an informal dispute resolution
conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations
and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution
process required by this paragraph.
10. Third-Party Interactions.
(a) Third-Party Websites, Applications and Advertisements. The Services may contain links to third-
party websites (“Third-Party Websites”) and applications (“Third-Party Applications”) and advertisements

dependent on the third party from which you received the application license, e.g., the Apple iPhone or

available defenses. This provision does not require you to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any
